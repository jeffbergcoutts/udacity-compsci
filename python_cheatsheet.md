## Memory

* fastest Memory is on the Register - temporary, built into processor, about a KB or 2 of memory
* next fastest is DRAM, on the Capacitors
* both store electrons
2 GB of RAM = 2**30 * 2 bytes
* 8 = 17 Billion bits (1 or 0)
latency of DRAM is 12 nanoseconds
* Hard drive stores magnetic - with a read and write arm - slow
